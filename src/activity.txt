Part 1: Critique Whitley’s code.
In a text file, list several ways in which Whitley’s code violates the 5 Principles.
    - Variable 'time' is unclear, it's not immediately obvious that it refer to the traffic light timer
    - Type Color—red, yellow, green—should be renamed Traffic Color 
    - Either remove the default, or clarify the error to explain why it shouldn't occur 
    - The conditional on time === 1 is repeated for all three cases, with only the outcome changing based on input 
    - Make '1' a constant variable
    - Length of timer (20) should be a modifiable variable for different traffic stops
    - Traffic stop length should also vary by color; for instance, yellow lights are shorter than red/green. This is an issue of hardcoding

Part 3: Critique own code.
Assumptions made:
    - Traffic lights have a hardcoded duration
    - All traffic lights have the same duration, no matter which traffic light they're at.
        - A stretch goal would be to let clients choose the duration of their traffic lights.
    - Assumes that red, yellow, and green will be the only traffic lights needed
    - Also assumes that their next state is green, red, yellow respectively
